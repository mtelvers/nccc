# 2023
{: .very-large}

![](/media/moseley-st-mary.jpg){: .align-right .width-half}

The 2023 competition was held at St Mary's Moseley and was won by Kingsteignton 1.  St Paul's Birmingham put in a very strong showing, coming a close second as well as picking up the certificate for _Best Ringing_.

The judges were Ian Avery and Paul Pascoe.

> The scoring system used by the judges allocated a maximum of 10% of the total score to the rise, 10% to the lower, and 80% to the top ringing (the call changes). This gave a score out of 100 expressed as a percentage. Out of interest, the judges also provided the faults scores that would have determined the contest under Devon Association rules. The top three positions would have been the same, with some places swapped lower down.
