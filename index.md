{: .very-large}

> Date:	Saturday 3rd June 2023   
> Place:	[St Mary’s Moseley, Birmingham](https://dove.cccbr.org.uk/tower/16431) Front 6 (7cwt)

The purpose of this national open call change competition is to widen the appreciation of and participation in competition call change ringing in the style practised in Devon and the south west of England.

One of the Central Council’s Strategic Priorities is that method ringing should not be the only measure of success, and that good call change ringing can be a target for many bands. Ringers in the south west have demonstrated this with their culture of focus on competition call change ringing.

The organisers hope that this competition will not only attract some really good exponents of competition call change ringing to come up from Devon and the South West, but also inspire other bands to focus on call change ringing and practice this particular style. 

# Eligibility

The competition is open to any band that is keen to try their hands at this style of ringing. 

Eligibility of band members will not be strict, but the spirit of the contest is that this is for local bands rather than bands assembling specifically to enter a competition. A ‘local band’ need not necessarily all be from the same tower though, recognising that many bands now cover a number of towers, or cluster together for learning and practice. Entries from university societies would be welcome.

# The Day and Programme

As some bands may be travelling from far afield, the local organisers will make sure there is a day of ringing available, with towers in the morning, ringing on the six at St Anne’s Moseley in parallel with the competition in the afternoon, and general ringing on all 10 at St Mary’s later in the day. There will be refreshments and a beer tent available at St Mary’s throughout the day. 

The final programme will depend on how many teams enter but the general principle will be: 

* Morning towers available in the south Birmingham area
* Assemble at St Mary’s Moseley at noon for welcome and draw
* Competition ringing in the afternoon, starting at 1pm
* Ringing at St Anne’s Moseley in parallel  
* Late afternoon tea and results (conclude by 6pm)
* Open ringing at Moseley

# Test Piece and Judging

Central to the test piece will be the call change sequence that is used in Devon Association competitions called “60 on 3rds”. This is a sequence of 60 changes that is fully explained in the eBook on call change ringing [callchanges.cccbr.org.uk](https://callchanges.cccbr.org.uk). The sequence is printed in the Ringing World diary and easily found with a google search such as this on the [Devon Association website](https://www.devonbells.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/sixties_on_thirds.pdf). 

As in Devon Association competitions, the test piece will include the raise and lower, with all of the ringing judged. This is the format of Devon Association competitions. However to make this contest more accessible to bands who are particularly not used to having ringing up and down marked, the allocation of marks will be as follows:

* Raise: 10% of the total marks
* Call changes: 80% of the total marks
* Lower: 10% of the total marks

This should mean that no band will be out of contention if their raise or lower doesn’t quite go according to plan!

The Judges are hoping to hear closed handstroke leads, which is the style practiced in Devon, but open handstroke leads will not be penalised provided they are consistent. 

In another change from Devon Association competitions, some practice on the bells will be allowed.
 
# Best Ringing

Another feature of Devon Association competitions that will be replicated is the awarding of a trophy for “Best Ringing” which is the test piece which, in the opinion of the judges, had the best ringing in it for a sustained period of time. This will not necessarily be the team that has the top score but is a more subjective award maybe for the band whose ringing has the most panache.

# Learning about call change ringing

The Central Council has published an eBook called ‘Devon Call Changes’, written by Simon Linford with help from representatives of the Devon Association. It uses linked YouTube videos to explain the principles and details of the Devon call change ringing style, including a step by step video guide to ringing 60 on 3rds, based on an excellent performance by the Shaugh Prior band. It can be found here [callchanges.cccbr.org.uk](https://callchanges.cccbr.org.uk)

The Association of Ringing Teachers has recently launched its ‘Advanced Call Change Ringing’ scheme, which introduces Devon call change ringing and includes tools and resources for aspiring call change bands. A toolkit can be found here [ringingteachers.org/advanced-call-change-toolbox](https://ringingteachers.org/advanced-call-change-toolbox)
