# NATIONAL CALL CHANGE COMPETITION
{: .very-large}

![](/media/moseley-st-mary.jpg){: .align-right .width-half}

> Date:	Saturday 3rd June 2023   
> Place:	[St Mary’s Moseley, Birmingham](https://dove.cccbr.org.uk/tower/16431) Front 6 (7cwt)

The purpose of this national open call change competition is to widen the appreciation of and participation in competition call change ringing in the style practised in Devon and the south west of England.

One of the Central Council’s Strategic Priorities is that method ringing should not be the only measure of success, and that good call change ringing can be a target for many bands. Ringers in the south west have demonstrated this with their culture of focus on competition call change ringing.

The competition mixed some really good exponents of competition call change ringing from Devon and the South West, with bands more used to method ringing.

> The scoring system used by the judges allocated a maximum of 10% of the total score to the rise, 10% to the lower, and 80% to the top ringing (the call changes). This gave a score out of 100 expressed as a percentage. Out of interest, the judges also provided the faults scores that would have determined the contest under Devon Association rules. The top three positions would have been the same, with some places swapped lower down.
