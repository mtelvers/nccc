{: .very-large}

![](/media/moseley-st-mary.jpg){: .align-right .width-half}

> Date:	Saturday 3rd June 2023   
> Place:	[St Mary’s Moseley, Birmingham](https://dove.cccbr.org.uk/tower/16431) Front 6 (7cwt)

The purpose of this national open call change competition is to widen the appreciation of and participation in competition call change ringing in the style practised in Devon and the south west of England.

One of the Central Council’s Strategic Priorities is that method ringing should not be the only measure of success, and that good call change ringing can be a target for many bands. Ringers in the south west have demonstrated this with their culture of focus on competition call change ringing.

The competition is mixing some really good exponents of competition call change ringing from Devon and the South West, with bands more used to method ringing.

The following teams have entered:

* Broadhempston, Devon

# The Day and Programme

Two towers have been arranged for ringing in the morning for those travelling from the south and south west. Both are just off the M5 in Worcestershire. There will be ringing on the testing six at St Anne’s Moseley in parallel with the competition in the afternoon, and general ringing on all 10 at St Mary’s later in the day. Tea and light refreshments will be available in the church all day. The headquarters pub is the Wetherspoon, _Elizabeth of York_, which is opposite the church. The upstairs room is reserved, and the bells are audible from there.

The final programme will depend on how many teams enter but the general principle will be: 

* Morning ringing at [Strensham](https://dove.cccbr.org.uk/tower/15577) from 9:30 and [Stoulton](https://dove.cccbr.org.uk/tower/16881) from 10:00
* Assemble at St Mary’s Moseley from noon for welcome and draw at 12:30
* Competition ringing 1pm - 5pm
* Ringing at St Anne’s Moseley in parallel  
* 5pm tea and results (conclude by 6pm)
* Open ringing at Moseley
* Note there is no service before or after

# Test Piece and Judging

Central to the test piece will be the call change sequence that is used in Devon Association competitions called “60 on 3rds”. This is a sequence of 60 changes that is fully explained in the eBook on call change ringing [callchanges.cccbr.org.uk](https://callchanges.cccbr.org.uk). Note that the competition test piece is the **Full Peal**. The sequence is printed in the Ringing World diary and easily found with a google search such as this on the [Devon Association website](https://www.devonbells.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/sixties_on_thirds.pdf). 

As in Devon Association competitions, the test piece will include the raise and lower, with all of the ringing judged. This is the format of Devon Association competitions. However to make this contest more accessible to bands who are particularly not used to having ringing up and down marked, the allocation of marks will be as follows:

* Raise: 10% of the total marks
* Call changes: 80% of the total marks
* Lower: 10% of the total marks

This should mean that no band will be out of contention if their raise or lower doesn’t quite go according to plan!

The Judges are hoping to hear closed handstroke leads, which is the style practiced in Devon, but open handstroke leads will not be penalised provided they are consistent. 

In another change from Devon Association competitions, some practice on the bells will be allowed.
 
# Best Ringing

Another feature of Devon Association competitions that will be replicated is the awarding of a trophy for “Best Ringing” which is the test piece which, in the opinion of the judges, had the best ringing in it for a sustained period of time. This will not necessarily be the team that has the top score but is a more subjective award maybe for the band whose ringing has the most panache.

# Getting to Moseley and local map

If you are coming from the south west or south east, the best way into Moseley is to come off the M42 and up the A435. Ignore any satnav that suggests the A38 or the A441. The A435 comes straight up and is the road that ends up in Moseley village. It can be a bit slow coming through Kings Heath but there is an advantage in the route’s simplicity.
 
There is a village car park, the entrance to which is opposite the Post Office just before the main crossroads in the middle of Moseley. That car park is £4.50 all day. If you find you have time to spare, free parking on residential streets is shown on this map but you may end up 10 minutes away.
 
The Wetherspoons provides a link from the car park to the main road and church, and there is also an alleyway from the corner of the car park through to the main road.

# Learning about call change ringing

The Central Council has published an eBook called ‘Devon Call Changes’, written by Simon Linford with help from representatives of the Devon Association. It uses linked YouTube videos to explain the principles and details of the Devon call change ringing style, including a step by step video guide to ringing 60 on 3rds, based on an excellent performance by the Shaugh Prior band. It can be found here [callchanges.cccbr.org.uk](https://callchanges.cccbr.org.uk)

The Association of Ringing Teachers has recently launched its ‘Advanced Call Change Ringing’ scheme, which introduces Devon call change ringing and includes tools and resources for aspiring call change bands. A toolkit can be found here [ringingteachers.org/advanced-call-change-toolbox](https://ringingteachers.org/advanced-call-change-toolbox)
