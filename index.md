# NATIONAL CALL CHANGE COMPETITON
{: .very-large}

The 2025 competition was held at Coaley in Gloucestershire. It was won by St Paul’s Birmingham, with Kingsteignton in second place – a reverse of last year’s top two positions. Third and fourth places went to Bristol and Bow – again a reverse of last year’s positions. This is therefore for the first time a non Devon or “Muggle” band has won this competition.

The judges were Matthew Hilling of Exeter and Chris Poole of Stonehouse
