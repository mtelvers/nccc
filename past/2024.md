# NATIONAL CALL CHANGE COMPETITON
{: .very-large}

The 2024 competition was held at the Lord Mayor’s Chapel in Bristol and was won by Kingsteignton. Two non-Devon teams, St Paul’s Birmingham and Brisol, came second and third, with Birmingham therefore picking up the certificate for _“Top Muggles”_.

The judges were Owen Borlase and Chris Kippin.

We are exploring the possibility of next year’s contest being hosted by Stroud Valleys, and again should be in the first Saturday in June.
